# wacky-races-ui
View upcoming wacky races

## Pre-requisites
The Wacky-races service must be running - see https://github.com/burnsy-simple/wacky-races

## To run
cd wacky-races-ui  
npm install  
npm run start  

## Notes
The UI runs on http://lvh.me  
You may need an entry like  
127.0.0.1 lvh.me  
in your local hosts file

## There is still some outstanding work
- add the race details screen
- implement the coutdown timer
- refresh the home page when appropriate
